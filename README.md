## Introduction

Moodle [https://moodle.org](https://moodle.org) is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators and learners with a single robust, secure and integrated system to create personalised learning environments. Moodle is written in PHP and JavaScript and uses an SQL database for storing the data.

## Quick Install

1) Move the Moodle files into your web directory.
2) Create a single database for Moodle to store all its tables in (or choose an existing database).
3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser, you should be taken to the install.php script, which will lead you through creating a config.php file and then setting up Moodle, creating an admin account etc.
4) Set up a cron task to call the file admin/cron.php every five minutes or so.
